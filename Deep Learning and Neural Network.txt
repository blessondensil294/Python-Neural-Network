Forward propagation
passed information thru the networks of hidden layers to get the output
weights are passed as input to the hidden layers

Forward propagation
● Multiply - add process
● Dot product
● Forward propagation for one data point at a time
● Output is the prediction for that data point

Activation functions
in hidden layers
to capture non linearity
	linear functions
	non linear functions
Applied to node inputs to produce node output

Rectified Linear Activation
The Rectified Linear Activation Function

As Dan explained to you in the video, an "activation function" is a function applied at each node. It converts the node's input into some output.

The rectified linear activation function (called ReLU) has been shown to lead to very high-performance networks. This function takes a single number as an input, returning 0 if the input is negative, and the input if the input is positive.

In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: input_data = np.array([-1, 2])
In [3]: weights = {'node_0': np.array([3, 3]),
...: 'node_1': np.array([1, 5]),
...: 'output': np.array([2, -1])}
In [4]: node_0_input = (input_data * weights['node_0']).sum()

In [5]: node_0_output = np.tanh(node_0_input)

In [6]: node_1_input = (input_data * weights['node_1']).sum()

In [7]: node_1_output = np.tanh(node_1_input)

In [8]: hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])
In [9]: output = (hidden_layer_output * weights['output']).sum()
In [10]: print(output)

def relu(input):
    '''Define your relu activation function here'''
    # Calculate the value for the output of the relu function: output
    output = max(0, input)
    
    # Return the value just calculated
    return(output)

# Calculate node 0 value: node_0_output
node_0_input = (input_data * weights['node_0']).sum()
node_0_output = relu(node_0_input)

# Calculate node 1 value: node_1_output
node_1_input = (input_data * weights['node_1']).sum()
node_1_output = relu(node_1_input)

# Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])

Applying the network to many observations/rows of data
You'll now define a function called predict_with_network() which will generate predictions for multiple data observations, which are pre-loaded as input_data. As before, weights are also pre-loaded. In addition, the relu() function you defined in the previous exercise has been pre-loaded.

# Define predict_with_network()
def predict_with_network(input_data_row, weights):

    # Calculate node 0 value
    node_0_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_0']).sum()
    node_0_output = relu(node_0_input)

    # Calculate node 1 value
    node_1_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_1']).sum()
    node_1_output = relu(node_1_input)

    # Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
    hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])
    
    # Calculate model output
    input_to_final_layer = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()
    model_output = relu(input_to_final_layer)
    
    # Return model output
    return(model_output)


# Create empty list to store prediction results
results = []
for input_data_row in input_data:
    # Append prediction to results
    results.append(predict_with_network(input_data_row, weights))

# Print results
print(results)


Deeper Networks

Representation learning
● Deep networks internally build representations of pa"erns in
the data
● Partially replace the need for feature engineering
● Subsequent layers build increasingly sophisticated
representations of raw data

Deep learning
● Modeler doesn’t need to specify the interactions
● When you train the model, the neural network gets weights
that find the relevant pa"erns to make be"er predictions


Multi-layer neural networks
In this exercise, you'll write code to do forward propagation for a neural network with 2 hidden layers. Each hidden layer has two nodes. The input data has been preloaded as input_data. The nodes in the first hidden layer are called node_0_0 and node_0_1. Their weights are pre-loaded as weights['node_0_0'] and weights['node_0_1'] respectively.

The nodes in the second hidden layer are called node_1_0 and node_1_1. Their weights are pre-loaded as weights['node_1_0'] and weights['node_1_1'] respectively.

We then create a model output from the hidden nodes using weights pre-loaded as weights['output'].

def predict_with_network(input_data):
    # Calculate node 0 in the first hidden layer
    node_0_0_input = (input_data * weights['node_0_0']).sum()
    node_0_0_output = relu(node_0_0_input)

    # Calculate node 1 in the first hidden layer
    node_0_1_input = (input_data * weights['node_0_1']).sum()
    node_0_1_output = relu(node_0_1_input)

    # Put node values into array: hidden_0_outputs
    hidden_0_outputs = np.array([node_0_0_output, node_0_1_output])

    # Calculate node 0 in the second hidden layer
    node_1_0_input = (hidden_0_outputs * weights['node_1_0']).sum()
    node_1_0_output = relu(node_1_0_input)

    # Calculate node 1 in the second hidden layer
    node_1_1_input = (hidden_0_outputs * weights['node_1_1']).sum()
    node_1_1_output = relu(node_1_1_input)

    # Put node values into array: hidden_1_outputs
    hidden_1_outputs = np.array([node_1_0_output, node_1_1_output])
    
    # Calculate output here: model_output
    model_output = (hidden_1_outputs * weights['output']).sum()
    
    # Return model_output
    return(model_output)

output = predict_with_network(input_data)
print(output)

Optimization

Predictions with multiple points
● Making accurate predictions gets harder with more points
● At any set of weights, there are many values of the error
● … corresponding to the many points we make predictions for

Loss function
● Aggregates errors in predictions from many data points into
single number
● Measure of model’s predictive performance

Squared error loss function
Prediction Actual Error Squared Error
10 20 -10 100
8 3 5 25
6 1 5 25
● Total Squared Error: 150
● Mean Squared Error: 50

Loss function
● Lower loss function value means a be!er model
● Goal: Find the weights that give the lowest value for the loss
function
● Gradient descent

Gradient descent
● Imagine you are in a pitch dark field
● Want to find the lowest point
● Feel the ground to see how it slopes
● Take a small step downhill
● Repeat until it is uphill in every direction

Gradient descent steps
● Start at random point
● Until you are somewhere flat:
● Find the slope
● Take a step downhill

Coding how weight changes affect accuracy
Now you'll get to change weights in a real network and see how they affect model accuracy!

Have a look at the following neural network: Ch2Ex4

Its weights have been pre-loaded as weights_0. Your task in this exercise is to update a single weight in weights_0 to create weights_1, which gives a perfect prediction (in which the predicted value is equal to target_actual: 3).

# The data point you will make a prediction for
input_data = np.array([0, 3])

# Sample weights
weights_0 = {'node_0': [2, 1],
             'node_1': [1, 2],
             'output': [1, 1]
            }

# The actual target value, used to calculate the error
target_actual = 3

# Make prediction using original weights
model_output_0 = predict_with_network(input_data, weights_0)

# Calculate error: error_0
error_0 = model_output_0 - target_actual

# Create weights that cause the network to make perfect prediction (3): weights_1
weights_1 = {'node_0': [2, 1],
             'node_1': [1, 2],
             'output': [1, 0]
            }

# Make prediction using new weights: model_output_1
model_output_1 = predict_with_network(input_data, weights_1)

# Calculate error: error_1
error_1 = model_output_1 - target_actual

# Print error_0 and error_1
print(error_0)
print(error_1)


Scaling up to multiple data points
You've seen how different weights will have different accuracies on a single prediction. But usually, you'll want to measure model accuracy on many points. You'll now write code to compare model accuracies for two different sets of weights, which have been stored as weights_0 and weights_1.

input_data is a list of arrays. Each item in that list contains the data to make a single prediction. target_actuals is a list of numbers. Each item in that list is the actual value we are trying to predict.

In this exercise, you'll use the mean_squared_error() function from sklearn.metrics. It takes the true values and the predicted values as arguments.

You'll also use the preloaded predict_with_network() function, which takes an array of data as the first argument, and weights as the second argument.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create model_output_0 
model_output_0 = []
# Create model_output_1
model_output_1 = []

# Loop over input_data
for row in input_data:
    # Append prediction to model_output_0
    model_output_0.append(predict_with_network(row, weights_0))
    
    # Append prediction to model_output_1
    model_output_1.append(predict_with_network(row, weights_1))

# Calculate the mean squared error for model_output_0: mse_0
mse_0 = mean_squared_error(target_actuals, model_output_0)

# Calculate the mean squared error for model_output_1: mse_1
mse_1 = mean_squared_error(target_actuals, model_output_1)

# Print mse_0 and mse_1
print("Mean squared error with weights_0: %f" %mse_0)
print("Mean squared error with weights_1: %f" %mse_1)


Gradient descent

● If the slope is positive:
● Going opposite the slope means moving to lower
numbers
● Subtract the slope from the current value
● Too big a step might lead us astray
● Solution: learning rate
● Update each weight by subtracting
learning rate * slope

Slope calculation example
● To calculate the slope for a weight, need to multiply:
● Slope of the loss function w.r.t value at the node we
feed into
● The value of the node that feeds into our weight
● Slope of the activation function w.r.t value we
feed into


Calculating slopes
You're now going to practice calculating slopes. When plotting the mean-squared error loss function against predictions, the slope is 2 * x * (y-xb), or 2 * input_data * error. Note that x and b may have multiple numbers (x is a vector for each data point, and b is a vector). In this case, the output will also be a vector, which is exactly what you want.

You're ready to write the code to calculate this slope while using a single data point. You'll use pre-defined weights called weights as well as data for a single point called input_data. The actual value of the target you want to predict is stored in target.

# Calculate the predictions: preds
preds = (weights * input_data).sum()

# Calculate the error: error
error = target - preds

# Calculate the slope: slope
slope = 2 * input_data * error

# Print the slope
print(slope)


Improving model weights
Hurray! You've just calculated the slopes you need. Now it's time to use those slopes to improve your model. If you add the slopes to your weights, you will move in the right direction. However, it's possible to move too far in that direction. So you will want to take a small step in that direction first, using a lower learning rate, and verify that the model is improving.

The weights have been pre-loaded as weights, the actual value of the target as target, and the input data as input_data. The predictions from the initial weights are stored as preds.

# Set the learning rate: learning_rate
learning_rate = 0.01

# Calculate the predictions: preds
preds = (weights * input_data).sum()

# Calculate the error: error
error = preds - target

# Calculate the slope: slope
slope = 2 * input_data * error

# Update the weights: weights_updated
weights_updated = weights - learning_rate * slope

# Get updated predictions: preds_updated
preds_updated = (weights_updated * input_data).sum()

# Calculate updated error: error_updated
error_updated = preds_updated - target

# Print the original error
print(error)

# Print the updated error
print(error_updated)


Making multiple updates to weights
You're now going to make multiple updates so you can dramatically improve your model weights, and see how the predictions improve with each update.

To keep your code clean, there is a pre-loaded get_slope() function that takes input_data, target, and weights as arguments. There is also a get_mse() function that takes the same arguments. The input_data, target, and weights have been pre-loaded.

This network does not have any hidden layers, and it goes directly from the input (with 3 nodes) to an output node. Note that weights is a single array.

We have also pre-loaded matplotlib.pyplot, and the error history will be plotted after you have done your gradient descent steps.

n_updates = 20
mse_hist = []

# Iterate over the number of updates
for i in range(n_updates):
    # Calculate the slope: slope
    slope = get_slope(input_data, target, weights)
    
    # Update the weights: weights
    weights = weights - 0.01 * slope
    
    # Calculate mse with new weights: mse
    mse = get_mse(input_data, target, weights)
    
    # Append the mse to mse_hist
    mse_hist.append(mse)

# Plot the mse history
plt.plot(mse_hist)


Backpropagation

● Allows gradient descent to update all weights in neural network (by
getting gradients for all weights)
● Comes from chain rule of calculus
● Important to understand the process, but you will generally use a
library that implements this


Backpropagation process
● Trying to estimate the slope of the loss function w.r.t each weight
● Do forward propagation to calculate predictions and errors

Backpropagation process
● Go back one layer at a time
● Gradients for weight is product of:
1. Node value feeding into that weight
2. Slope of loss function w.r.t node it feeds into
3. Slope of activation function at the node it feeds into

Backpropagation process
● Need to also keep track of the slopes of the loss function
w.r.t node values
● Slope of node values are the sum of the slopes for all
weights that come out of them

Backpropagation: Recap
● Start at some random set of weights
● Use forward propagation to make a prediction
● Use backward propagation to calculate the slope of
the loss function w.r.t each weight
● Multiply that slope by the learning rate, and subtract
from the current weights
● Keep going with that cycle until we get to a flat part

Stochastic gradient descent
● It is common to calculate slopes on only a subset of the
data (‘batch’)
● Use a different batch of data to calculate the next
update
● Start over from the beginning once all data is used
● Each time through the training data is called an epoch
● When slopes are calculated on one batch at a time:
stochastic gradient descent

Model specification
In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: from keras.layers import Dense
In [3]: from keras.models import Sequential

In [4]: predictors = np.loadtxt('predictors_data.csv', delimiter=',')
In [5]: n_cols = predictors.shape[1]

In [6]: model = Sequential()
In [7]: model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = (n_cols,)))
In [8]: model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
In [9]: model.add(Dense(1))

Specifying a model
Now you'll get to work with your first model in Keras, and will immediately be able to run more complex neural network models on larger datasets compared to the first two chapters.

To start, you'll take the skeleton of a neural network and add a hidden layer and an output layer. You'll then fit that model and see Keras do the optimization so your model continually gets better.

As a start, you'll predict workers wages based on characteristics like their industry, education and level of experience. You can find the dataset in a pandas dataframe called df. For convenience, everything in df except for the target has been converted to a NumPy matrix called predictors. The target, wage_per_hour, is available as a NumPy matrix called target.

For all exercises in this chapter, we've imported the Sequential model constructor, the Dense layer constructor, and pandas.

# Import necessary modules
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
n_cols = predictors.shape[1]

# Set up the model: model
model = Sequential()

# Add the first layer
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_cols,)))

# Add the second layer
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))

# Add the output layer
model.add(Dense(1))


Compiling and filling a model

Why you need to compile your model
● Specify the optimizer
● Many options and mathematically complex
● “Adam” is usually a good choice - adjust the learning rate as it does gradient descent

Loss function
● “mean_squared_error” common for regression

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

What is filling a model
● Applying backpropagation and gradient descent with your
data to update the weights
● Scaling data before fi!ing can ease optimization

model.fit(predictors, target)


Classification models

● ‘categorical_crossentropy’ loss function
● Similar to log loss: Lower is better
● Add metrics = [‘accuracy’] to compile step for easy-tounderstand
diagnostics
● Output layer has separate node for each possible outcome,
and uses ‘softmax’ activation


# Import necessary modules
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential
In[1]: from keras.utils import to_categorical

In[2]: data = pd.read_csv('basketball_shot_log.csv')
In[3]: predictors = data.drop(['shot_result'], axis=1).as_matrix()
In[4]: target = to_categorical(data.shot_result)

In[5]: model = Sequential()
In[6]: model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = (n_cols,)))
In[7]: model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
In[8]: model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
In[9]: model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

In[10]: model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy',
...: metrics=['accuracy'])
In[11]: model.fit(predictors, target)


Convert df.survived to a categorical variable using the to_categorical() function.
Specify a Sequential model called model.
Add a Dense layer with 32 nodes. Use 'relu' as the activation and (n_cols,) as the input_shape.
Add the Dense output layer. Because there are two outcomes, it should have 2 units, and because it is a classification model, the activation should be 'softmax'.
Compile the model, using 'sgd' as the optimizer, 'categorical_crossentropy' as the loss function, and metrics=['accuracy'] to see the accuracy (what fraction of predictions were correct) at the end of each epoch.
Fit the model using the predictors and the target.


# Import necessary modules
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.utils import to_categorical

# Convert the target to categorical: target
target = to_categorical(df.survived)

# Set up the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the first layer
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_cols,)))

# Add the output layer
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model

Making predictions
The trained network from your previous coding exercise is now stored as model. New data to make predictions is stored in a NumPy array as pred_data. Use model to make predictions on your new data.

# Specify, compile, and fit the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape = (n_cols,)))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(predictors, target)

# Calculate predictions: predictions
predictions = model.predict(pred_data)

# Calculate predicted probability of survival: predicted_prob_true
predicted_prob_true = predictions[:,1]

# print predicted_prob_true
print(predicted_prob_true)


Understanding model optimization

Why optimization is hard
● Simultaneously optimizing 1000s of parameters with
complex relationships
● Updates may not improve model meaningfully
● Updates too small (if learning rate is low) or too large (if
learning rate is high)

Stochastic gradient descent
	
def get_new_model(input_shape = input_shape):
	model = Sequential()
	model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = input_shape))
	model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
	model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))
	return(model)
	
lr_to_test = [.000001, 0.01, 1]

# loop over learning rates
for lr in lr_to_test:
	model = get_new_model()
	my_optimizer = SGD(lr=lr)
	model.compile(optimizer = my_optimizer, loss = 'categorical_crossentropy')
	model.fit(predictors, target)
	


Vanishing gradients
● Occurs when many layers have very small slopes (e.g. due to
being on flat part of tanh curve)
● In deep networks, updates to backprop were close to 0

Changing optimization parameters
It's time to get your hands dirty with optimization. You'll now try optimizing a model at a very low learning rate, a very high learning rate, and a "just right" learning rate. You'll want to look at the results after running this exercise, remembering that a low value for the loss function is good.

For these exercises, we've pre-loaded the predictors and target values from your previous classification models (predicting who would survive on the Titanic). You'll want the optimization to start from scratch every time you change the learning rate, to give a fair comparison of how each learning rate did in your results. So we have created a function get_new_model() that creates an unoptimized model to optimize.

# Import the SGD optimizer
from keras.optimizers import SGD

# Create list of learning rates: lr_to_test
lr_to_test = [.000001, 0.01, 1]

# Loop over learning rates
for lr in lr_to_test:
    print('\n\nTesting model with learning rate: %f\n'%lr )
    
    # Build new model to test, unaffected by previous models
    model = get_new_model()
    
    # Create SGD optimizer with specified learning rate: my_optimizer
    my_optimizer = SGD(lr=lr)
    
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer=my_optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy')
    
    # Fit the model
    model.fit(predictors, target)

	
Model validation

Validation in deep learning
● Commonly use validation split rather than crossvalidation
● Deep learning widely used on large datasets
● Single validation score is based on large amount of
data, and is reliable
● Repeated training from cross-validation would take
long time

Goal is to have the best validation score possible and use early stopping when the validation score is not imporving so stop training 

In [1]: model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

Early Stopping
In [3]: from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

Evaluating model accuracy on validation dataset
Now it's your turn to monitor model accuracy with a validation data set. A model definition has been provided as model. Your job is to add the code to compile it and then fit it. You'll check the validation score in each epoch.

# Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
n_cols = predictors.shape[1]
input_shape = (n_cols,)

# Specify the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = input_shape))
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model
hist = model.fit(predictors, target, validation_split=0.3)


Early stopping: Optimizing the optimization
Now that you know how to monitor your model performance throughout optimization, you can use early stopping to stop optimization when it isn't helping any more. Since the optimization stops automatically when it isn't helping, you can also set a high value for epochs in your call to .fit(), as Dan showed in the video.

The model you'll optimize has been specified as model. As before, the data is pre-loaded as predictors and target.

# Import EarlyStopping
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
n_cols = predictors.shape[1]
input_shape = (n_cols,)

# Specify the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = input_shape))
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Define early_stopping_monitor
early_stopping_monitor = EarlyStopping(patience=2)

# Fit the model
model.fit(predictors, target, epochs=30, validation_split=0.3, callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor])


Experimenting with wider networks
Now you know everything you need to begin experimenting with different models!

A model called model_1 has been pre-loaded. You can see a summary of this model printed in the IPython Shell. This is a relatively small network, with only 10 units in each hidden layer.

In this exercise you'll create a new model called model_2 which is similar to model_1, except it has 100 units in each hidden layer.

After you create model_2, both models will be fitted, and a graph showing both models loss score at each epoch will be shown. We added the argument verbose=False in the fitting commands to print out fewer updates, since you will look at these graphically instead of as text.

Because you are fitting two models, it will take a moment to see the outputs after you hit run, so be patient.

# Define early_stopping_monitor
early_stopping_monitor = EarlyStopping(patience=2)

# Create the new model: model_2
model_2 = Sequential()

# Add the first and second layers
model_2.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
model_2.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))

# Add the output layer
model_2.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model_2
model_2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit model_1
model_1_training = model_1.fit(predictors, target, epochs=15, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor], verbose=False)

# Fit model_2
model_2_training = model_2.fit(predictors, target, epochs=15, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor], verbose=False)

# Create the plot
plt.plot(model_1_training.history['val_loss'], 'r', model_2_training.history['val_loss'], 'b')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Validation score')
plt.show()


Adding layers to a network
You've seen how to experiment with wider networks. In this exercise, you'll try a deeper network (more hidden layers).

Once again, you have a baseline model called model_1 as a starting point. It has 1 hidden layer, with 50 units. You can see a summary of that model's structure printed out. You will create a similar network with 3 hidden layers (still keeping 50 units in each layer).

This will again take a moment to fit both models, so you'll need to wait a few seconds to see the results after you run your code.

# The input shape to use in the first hidden layer
input_shape = (n_cols,)

# Create the new model: model_2
model_2 = Sequential()

# Add the first, second, and third hidden layers
model_2.add(Dense(50, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
model_2.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model_2.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))

# Add the output layer
model_2.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model_2
model_2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit model 1
model_1_training = model_1.fit(predictors, target, epochs=20, validation_split=0.4, callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor], verbose=False)

# Fit model 2
model_2_training = model_2.fit(predictors, target, epochs=20, validation_split=0.4, callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor], verbose=False)

# Create the plot
plt.plot(model_1_training.history['val_loss'], 'r', model_2_training.history['val_loss'], 'b')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Validation score')
plt.show()


Thinking about model capacity 

Workflow for optimizing model capacity
● Start with a small network
● Gradually increase capacity
● Keep increasing capacity until validation score is no longer improving



Keras input and dense layers

Inputs

Input layers
The first step in creating a neural network model is to define the Input layer. This layer takes in raw data, usually in the form of numpy arrays. The shape of the Input layer defines how many variables your neural network will use. For example, if the input data has 10 columns, you define an Input layer with a shape of (10,).

In this case, you are only using one input in your network.


from keras.layers import Input
input_tensor = Input(shape=(1,))
print(input_tensor)

<tf.Tensor 'input_1:0' shape=(?, 1) dtype=float32>

Outputs

Dense layers
Once you have an Input layer, the next step is to add a Dense layer.

Dense layers learn a weight matrix, where the first dimension of the matrix is the dimension of the input data, and the second dimension is the dimension of the output data. Recall that your Input layer has a shape of 1. In this case, your output layer will also have a shape of 1. This means that the Dense layer will learn a 1x1 weight matrix.

In this exercise, you will add a dense layer to your model, after the input layer.

from keras.layers import Dense
output_layer = Dense(1)
print(output_layer)

<keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x7f22e0295a58>


Connecting inputs to outputs
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
input_tensor = Input(shape=(1,))
output_layer = Dense(1)
output_tensor = output_layer(input_tensor)


print(output_tensor)

<tf.Tensor 'dense_1/BiasAdd:0' shape=(?, 1) dtype=float32>

Build and compile a model

Keras models

from keras.layers import Input, Dense
input_tensor = Input(shape=(1,))
output_tensor = Dense(1)(input_tensor)


from keras.models import Model
model = Model(input_tensor, output_tensor)

Compile a model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae')
